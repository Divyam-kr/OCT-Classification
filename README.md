# OCT Image Processing and Classification

Welcome to the OCT Image Processing and Classification project! This project involves three main components:

1. *Denoising*: OCT images are denoised using CycleGANs.
2. *Super-Resolution*: Denoised images are enhanced using ESRGAN for super-resolution.
3. *Volumetric Classification*: Super-resolved images are classified using a 3D CNN architecture.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to processing and classifying optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. By combining denoising, super-resolution, and classification techniques, we aim to improve the quality and accuracy of medical imaging analysis.

## Methods

### Denoising with CycleGANs
- *Description*: OCT images often contain noise that can hinder analysis. We employ CycleGANs to denoise these images effectively.
- *Details*: The CycleGAN model is trained using unpaired datasets to learn how to translate noisy images to denoised ones.

### Super-Resolution with ESRGAN
- *Description*: After denoising, we enhance the images using ESRGAN to achieve super-resolution.
- *Details*: The ESRGAN model is trained on pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution images to produce high-quality super-resolved images.

### Volumetric Classification with 3D CNN
- *Description*: We classify volumetric OCT images using a 3D CNN architecture.
- *Details*: The 3D CNN model is trained to classify images into different categories based on their volumetric features.

## Data

- *Dataset*: Provide information on the dataset used, including how to obtain it and any preprocessing steps.
- *Data Structure*: Describe the data structure and how the data is organized.
